# MLOps introductory course on Microsoft Azure Cloud

This course is designed to be held during 3 classes lasting 3 hours each. This course will span over 9 hours.

## A bit of context

MLOps is a rapidly evolving field that combines machine learning and software engineering to streamline the deployment, monitoring, and maintenance of machine learning models in production. As machine learning systems become increasingly complex, the need for robust workflows and efficient collaboration between data scientists and engineers grows. This class will focus on the tools and practices that enable teams to develop and deploy machine learning models at scale. The goal is to equip students with the skills necessary to manage the full lifecycle of machine learning models, from experimentation to deployment and monitoring, using industry-standard tools and platforms.
